Division of work listed:             ____ / 2.5 

One base case clearly described:     ____ / 2.5

One edge case clearly described:     ____ / 2.5

needed for reproducibility:          ____ / 5

clearly delineated:                  ____ / 5

Postconditions result in neither
false positive nor false negative
defects:                             ____ / 10

>= 1 Requirement per TC:             ____ / 10

* Defects Found and Described: 30% of grade

Must be >= 3 defects! 10% off for each missing one.

Expected behavior is accurate
according to requirements:           ____ / 5

Observed behavior shows program
behavior verbatim to help debugging: ____ / 5

Clearly written:                     ____ / 10
